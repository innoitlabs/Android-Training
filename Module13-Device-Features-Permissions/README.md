# Android Device Features & Permissions Learning Module

## Overview
This comprehensive learning module covers Android device-specific features, runtime permissions, and security best practices using Kotlin. The module includes both theoretical documentation and hands-on practical examples.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:
- Request and handle runtime permissions effectively
- Integrate camera functionality and capture images
- Use location services and GPS functionality
- Access and process sensor data from device sensors
- Work with the file system and storage APIs
- Implement biometric authentication
- Detect and use device-specific features
- Apply permission request patterns and UX best practices
- Follow security best practices when using sensitive features
- Test permissions and device features effectively
