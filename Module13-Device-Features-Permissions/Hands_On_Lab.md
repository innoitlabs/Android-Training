# Hands-On Lab: Secure Notes App

## Overview
This hands-on lab guides you through building a comprehensive secure notes application that integrates all the device features and security practices covered in this module.

## Project Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Note Management**: Create, read, update, and delete notes
2. **Camera Integration**: Attach photos to notes
3. **Location Tagging**: Add location information to notes
4. **Sensor Data**: Include device orientation and movement data
5. **Biometric Authentication**: Secure app access with fingerprint/face
6. **Secure Storage**: Encrypt sensitive note data
7. **Permission Handling**: Proper runtime permission management

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
- Create new Android project with Kotlin
- Add required dependencies for Room, Biometric, Location Services
- Configure permissions in AndroidManifest.xml

### Step 2: Data Layer
- Create Note entity with Room database
- Implement Repository pattern
- Add encryption for sensitive data

### Step 3: Security Layer
- Implement BiometricManager for authentication
- Create EncryptionManager for data encryption
- Add PermissionManager for runtime permissions

### Step 4: UI Layer
- Create authentication activity with biometric prompt
- Implement main activity with note list
- Add note creation/editing activity with camera integration

### Step 5: Device Features
- Integrate camera for photo capture
- Add location services for GPS tagging
- Implement sensor data collection
- Use FileProvider for secure file sharing

## Testing Scenarios
1. Biometric authentication flow
2. Camera integration and photo capture
3. Location services and GPS tagging
4. Permission request and handling
5. Data encryption and decryption
6. Sensor data collection and display

## Extension Ideas
- Cloud synchronization
- Advanced encryption algorithms
- Additional device features (microphone, NFC)
- Offline mode with local encryption
- Multi-user support with separate encryption keys
