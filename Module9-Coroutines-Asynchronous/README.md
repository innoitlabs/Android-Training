# Android Coroutines, Flows & Background Work - Complete Learning Guide

## Overview
This comprehensive learning material covers Android coroutines, flows, and background work patterns. The project includes both theoretical documentation and practical code examples.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:
- Understand coroutine basics and lifecycle
- Use coroutine scopes and dispatchers (Main, IO, Default)
- Apply async/await patterns with structured concurrency
- Handle exceptions and cancellations in coroutines
- Use Flow and StateFlow for reactive data streams
- Integrate coroutines with Room & Retrofit
- Perform background work with WorkManager
- Write unit tests for coroutines and flows
- Follow coroutine best practices and avoid anti-patterns
- Optimize performance with coroutine dispatchers and structured usage

## Quick Start
1. Read through the documentation files in order
2. Explore the Android project in `CoroutinesAsync/`
3. Build and run the project in Android Studio
4. Complete the hands-on exercises
5. Practice with the provided exercises

## Prerequisites
- Basic Android development knowledge
- Understanding of Kotlin syntax
- Android Studio installed
- Android device or emulator

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Coroutines**: Lightweight threads for asynchronous programming
- **Scopes**: Lifecycle-aware coroutine management
- **Dispatchers**: Thread management for different tasks
- **Flows**: Cold streams for reactive programming
- **StateFlow**: Hot streams for UI state management
- **Room Integration**: Database operations with coroutines
- **Retrofit Integration**: Network calls with suspend functions
- **WorkManager**: Background task scheduling
- **Testing**: Unit testing coroutines and flows

## Next Steps
After completing this material:
1. Build the sample app and experiment with the code
2. Try modifying the examples to understand the concepts better
3. Apply these patterns to your own Android projects
4. Explore advanced topics like custom dispatchers and flow operators
