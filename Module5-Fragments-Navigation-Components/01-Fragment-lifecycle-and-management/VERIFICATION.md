### Installation Details
- **Device**: Medium_Phone_API_35(AVD) - 15
- **APK**: app-debug.apk
- **Installation Time**: 13 seconds

## Project Components Verified

### 1. Dependencies ✅
- Navigation Component dependencies added
- Safe Args plugin configured
- All required libraries included

### 2. Navigation Graph ✅
- `nav_graph.xml` created with proper structure
- Three fragments defined: HomeFragment, DetailFragment, SettingsFragment
- Actions and arguments properly configured
- Start destination set to HomeFragment

### 3. Fragment Classes ✅
- **HomeFragment**: Complete lifecycle logging, navigation functionality
- **DetailFragment**: Safe Args usage, data display
- **SettingsFragment**: Back stack management
- All fragments include proper lifecycle method overrides

### 4. Layout Files ✅
- **activity_main.xml**: NavHostFragment properly configured
- **fragment_home.xml**: Input field and navigation buttons
- **fragment_detail.xml**: Welcome message display
- **fragment_settings.xml**: Back stack management UI

### 5. Animations ✅
- **slide_in_right.xml**: Slide in from right animation
- **slide_out_left.xml**: Slide out to left animation
- **slide_in_left.xml**: Slide in from left animation
- **slide_out_right.xml**: Slide out to right animation

### 6. Safe Args ✅
- Plugin properly applied in build.gradle.kts
- Arguments defined in navigation graph
- Type-safe navigation implemented in fragments

## Expected App Behavior

### Launch
1. App starts with HomeFragment
2. Title shows "Home Fragment"
3. Input field for username is displayed
4. Two navigation buttons are available

### Navigation Flow
1. **Home → Detail**: Enter username, click "Navigate to Detail"
2. **Detail Screen**: Shows personalized welcome message
3. **Detail → Settings**: Click "Go to Settings"
4. **Settings Screen**: Shows back stack management options
5. **Back Navigation**: Use back button or "Go Back" buttons

### Lifecycle Logging
- All Fragment lifecycle methods are logged to Logcat
- Filter by fragment names to see specific logs:
  - `HomeFragment`
  - `DetailFragment`
  - `SettingsFragment`

### Safe Args Testing
- Username is passed from HomeFragment to DetailFragment
- Default values work when no input is provided
- Type safety is maintained throughout navigation
