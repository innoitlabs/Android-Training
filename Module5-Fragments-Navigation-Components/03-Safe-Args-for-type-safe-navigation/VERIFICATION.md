## Testing Results

### Manual Testing Performed
1. **App Launch**: ✅ App launches successfully on emulator
2. **UI Display**: ✅ Home screen displays correctly with input fields
3. **Input Validation**: ✅ Empty name/age shows appropriate error messages
4. **Navigation**: ✅ Both navigation buttons work correctly
5. **Data Display**: ✅ Detail screen shows passed data correctly
6. **Back Navigation**: ✅ Back button returns to home screen

### Test Scenarios Verified
- ✅ Basic navigation with primitive types
- ✅ Navigation with complex User object
- ✅ Input validation for empty fields
- ✅ Input validation for invalid age
- ✅ Back navigation functionality

## Generated Safe Args Classes

The following classes were successfully generated:
- `HomeFragmentDirections`: Contains navigation actions
- `DetailFragmentArgs`: Contains argument retrieval

### Method Signature Verified
```kotlin
fun actionHomeFragmentToDetailFragment(
    username: String,
    age: Int,
    user: User?,
    isActive: Boolean = true
): NavDirections
```

## Performance Verification
