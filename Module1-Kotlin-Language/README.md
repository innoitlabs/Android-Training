# Kotlin Fundamentals for Android Development

Welcome to the Kotlin Fundamentals learning module! This comprehensive guide is designed specifically for Android developers who are new to Kotlin or want to strengthen their foundation.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Write clean, idiomatic Kotlin code
- Understand Kotlin's type system and data types
- Use variables and constants effectively
- Implement control flow structures
- Create functions and lambda expressions
- Apply Kotlin best practices in Android development

## 🎯 Topics Covered

1. **Kotlin Syntax and Basic Data Types**
   - Understanding Kotlin's syntax
   - Working with primitive types (Int, String, Boolean, Double, Float, Char)
   - Using Arrays and collections

2. **Variables and Constants**
   - `var` vs `val` (mutable vs immutable)
   - Type inference
   - Best practices for immutability

3. **Control Flow**
   - `if/else` expressions
   - `when` expressions (Kotlin's enhanced switch)
   - Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

4. **Functions and Lambda Expressions**
   - Function definitions and parameters
   - Return types and single-expression functions
   - Higher-order functions
   - Lambda expressions and closures
