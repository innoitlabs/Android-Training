echo "🚀 LifecycleExample - Android Activity Lifecycle Demo"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "📱 App Status:"
echo "- App has been installed on emulator"
echo "- App has been launched"
echo "- You should see the app running on your emulator"
echo ""

echo "🎯 What to expect on the emulator:"
echo "1. Toast messages appearing for each lifecycle event"
echo "2. Real-time counter and timer updates"
echo "3. Lifecycle counts displayed in the UI"
echo "4. Status updates showing current Activity state"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Testing Instructions:"
echo ""
echo "1. Basic App Launch:"
echo "   - Watch for Toast messages: 🎬 onCreate → 👁️ onStart → ▶️ onResume"
echo "   - Counter should start at 0 (or restored value)"
echo "   - Timer should begin counting every second"
echo "   - Status should show 'Activity is interactive'"
echo ""

echo "2. Press Home Button:"
echo "   - Watch for Toast messages: ⏸️ onPause → ⏹️ onStop"
echo "   - Timer should stop counting"
echo "   - Status should show 'Activity is completely hidden'"
echo "   - Counter and text input should be preserved"
echo ""

echo "3. Return to App:"
echo "   - Watch for Toast messages: 👁️ onStart → ▶️ onResume"
echo "   - Timer should resume counting"
echo "   - Status should show 'Activity is interactive'"
echo "   - Text input should be restored"
echo ""

echo "4. Screen Rotation:"
echo "   - Watch for full lifecycle sequence:"
echo "     ⏸️ onPause → ⏹️ onStop → 💀 onDestroy → 🎬 onCreate → 👁️ onStart → ▶️ onResume"
echo "   - Counter value should be preserved"
echo "   - Text input should be preserved"
echo "   - Timer should continue from where it left off"
echo ""

echo "5. Press Back Button:"
echo "   - Watch for Toast messages: ⏸️ onPause → ⏹️ onStop → 💀 onDestroy"
echo "   - App should close completely"
echo "   - All resources should be cleaned up"
echo ""

echo "📊 Monitoring Logs:"
echo "- Open Android Studio and go to Logcat"
echo "- Filter by 'MainActivityLifecycle'"
echo "- Look for logs with emojis for easy identification"
echo ""

echo "✨ Features Demonstrated:"
echo "✅ All 6 lifecycle methods implemented"
echo "✅ Toast messages for visual feedback"
echo "✅ State preservation (counter + text)"
echo "✅ Configuration change handling"
echo "✅ Resource management (Timer)"
echo "✅ Persistent storage (SharedPreferences)"
echo "✅ Real-time lifecycle counting"
echo "✅ Status updates and logging"
echo "✅ Memory leak prevention"
echo ""

echo "🎓 Learning Outcomes:"
echo "- Understanding when each lifecycle method is called"
echo "- Learning how to save and restore state"
echo "- Practicing proper resource management"
echo "- Seeing real-world lifecycle scenarios"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Next Steps:"
echo "1. Experiment with the app on the emulator"
echo "2. Try different scenarios (Home, Back, Rotation)"
echo "3. Check Logcat for detailed logs"
echo "4. Modify the code to add new features"
echo "5. Apply these concepts to your own projects"
echo ""

echo "🎉 The LifecycleExample app is now running and ready for testing!"
echo "Check your emulator to see the app in action."
