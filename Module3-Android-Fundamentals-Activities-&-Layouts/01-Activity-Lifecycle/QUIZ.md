## üß† Quiz Questions

### Section 1: Basic Lifecycle Understanding

#### Question 1
**What is the correct order of lifecycle methods when an Activity is first created?**

A) `onCreate()` ‚Üí `onStart()` ‚Üí `onResume()`  
B) `onStart()` ‚Üí `onCreate()` ‚Üí `onResume()`  
C) `onResume()` ‚Üí `onStart()` ‚Üí `onCreate()`  
D) `onCreate()` ‚Üí `onResume()` ‚Üí `onStart()`

**Answer**: A) `onCreate()` ‚Üí `onStart()` ‚Üí `onResume()`

**Explanation**: When an Activity is first created, Android calls `onCreate()` to initialize it, then `onStart()` when it becomes visible, and finally `onResume()` when it's ready for user interaction.

---

#### Question 2
**Which lifecycle method is called when the user presses the Home button?**

A) `onPause()` and `onStop()`  
B) `onPause()` only  
C) `onStop()` only  
D) `onDestroy()`

**Answer**: A) `onPause()` and `onStop()`

**Explanation**: When the user presses Home, the Activity is partially hidden (`onPause()`) and then completely hidden (`onStop()`), but not destroyed.

---

#### Question 3
**True or False: `onDestroy()` is always called when an Activity is finished.**

A) True  
B) False

**Answer**: B) False

**Explanation**: `onDestroy()` may not be called if the system kills the process to free memory. You should not rely on it for critical operations.

---

#### Question 4
**Which lifecycle method is the best place to save user data that should persist when the app is paused?**

A) `onCreate()`  
B) `onResume()`  
C) `onPause()`  
D) `onDestroy()`

**Answer**: C) `onPause()`

**Explanation**: `onPause()` is called when the Activity is partially hidden and is the best place to save user data quickly before the Activity might be stopped.

---

### Section 2: State Management

#### Question 5
**What method should you override to save state during configuration changes like screen rotation?**

A) `onSaveInstanceState()`  
B) `onRestoreInstanceState()`  
C) `onPause()`  
D) `onStop()`

**Answer**: A) `onSaveInstanceState()`

**Explanation**: `onSaveInstanceState()` is specifically designed to save temporary state that should be restored after configuration changes.

---

#### Question 6
**In which lifecycle method should you restore state from a Bundle?**

A) `onCreate()`  
B) `onStart()`  
C) `onResume()`  
D) `onRestoreInstanceState()`

**Answer**: A) `onCreate()`

**Explanation**: You should check for saved state in `onCreate()` using the `savedInstanceState` parameter and restore it there.

---

#### Question 7
**Which of the following is NOT a good practice for state management?**

A) Save lightweight state in `onPause()`  
B) Save configuration change state in `onSaveInstanceState()`  
C) Save critical data in `onDestroy()`  
D) Restore state in `onCreate()`

**Answer**: C) Save critical data in `onDestroy()`

**Explanation**: `onDestroy()` may not be called, so saving critical data there is unreliable. Use `onPause()` for critical data.

---

### Section 3: Resource Management

#### Question 8
**Where should you start a Timer that updates the UI every second?**

A) `onCreate()`  
B) `onStart()`  
C) `onResume()`  
D) `onPause()`

**Answer**: C) `onResume()`

**Explanation**: `onResume()` is called when the Activity is interactive, making it the best place to start UI-updating operations.

---

#### Question 9
**Where should you stop a Timer to prevent memory leaks?**

A) `onPause()`  
B) `onStop()`  
C) `onDestroy()`  
D) All of the above

**Answer**: A) `onPause()`

**Explanation**: Stop the Timer in `onPause()` since the Activity is no longer interactive, and also ensure it's stopped in `onDestroy()` for complete cleanup.

---

#### Question 10
**Which lifecycle method is best for registering broadcast receivers?**

A) `onCreate()`  
B) `onStart()`  
C) `onResume()`  
D) `onPause()`

**Answer**: B) `onStart()`

**Explanation**: Register receivers in `onStart()` when the Activity becomes visible, and unregister them in `onStop()` when it's completely hidden.

---

### Section 4: Configuration Changes

#### Question 11
**What happens to an Activity when the user rotates the screen?**

A) Only `onPause()` and `onResume()` are called  
B) The Activity is recreated from scratch  
C) Nothing happens  
D) Only `onStop()` is called

**Answer**: B) The Activity is recreated from scratch

**Explanation**: Screen rotation is a configuration change that causes the Activity to be destroyed and recreated, calling the full lifecycle sequence.

---

#### Question 12
**Which method is called during screen rotation to save state before the Activity is destroyed?**

A) `onPause()`  
B) `onStop()`  
C) `onSaveInstanceState()`  
D) `onDestroy()`

**Answer**: C) `onSaveInstanceState()`

**Explanation**: `onSaveInstanceState()` is called before the Activity is destroyed during configuration changes to save state for restoration.

---

### Section 5: Real-World Scenarios

#### Question 13
**You're building a video player app. Where should you pause the video when the user receives a phone call?**

A) `onCreate()`  
B) `onStart()`  
C) `onPause()`  
D) `onStop()`

**Answer**: C) `onPause()`

**Explanation**: When a phone call comes in, the Activity is partially hidden, so `onPause()` is the right place to pause the video.

---

#### Question 14
**In a GPS navigation app, where should you start location updates?**

A) `onCreate()`  
B) `onStart()`  
C) `onResume()`  
D) `onPause()`

**Answer**: C) `onResume()`

**Explanation**: Start location updates in `onResume()` when the Activity is interactive and the user can see the navigation.

---

#### Question 15
**Where should you stop location updates to save battery?**

A) `onPause()`  
B) `onStop()`  
C) `onDestroy()`  
D) Both A and B

**Answer**: D) Both A and B

**Explanation**: Stop location updates in `onPause()` when the Activity is partially hidden, and ensure they're stopped in `onStop()` when completely hidden.

---

### Section 6: Code Analysis

#### Question 16
**Look at this code snippet. What's wrong with it?**

```kotlin
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    // Initialize views and data
}
```

A) Nothing is wrong  
B) `super.onCreate()` should be called first  
C) `setContentView()` should be called after `super.onCreate()`  
D) The Bundle parameter is not used

**Answer**: B) `super.onCreate()` should be called first

**Explanation**: Always call `super.onCreate()` before any other operations in `onCreate()`.

---

#### Question 17
**What will happen if you don't call `super.onPause()` in your `onPause()` method?**

A) Nothing, it's optional  
B) The app will crash  
C) The Activity won't pause properly  
D) Memory leaks will occur

**Answer**: C) The Activity won't pause properly

**Explanation**: Not calling `super.onPause()` prevents the parent class from performing necessary cleanup operations.

---

#### Question 18
**In this code, when will the counter be saved?**

```kotlin
override fun onPause() {
    super.onPause()
    sharedPreferences.edit().putInt("counter", counter).apply()
}

override fun onSaveInstanceState(outState: Bundle) {
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState)
    outState.putInt("counter", counter)
}
```

A) Only when the app is paused  
B) Only during configuration changes  
C) Both when paused and during configuration changes  
D) Never

**Answer**: C) Both when paused and during configuration changes

**Explanation**: The counter is saved in `onPause()` for app lifecycle changes and in `onSaveInstanceState()` for configuration changes.

---

### Section 7: Advanced Concepts

#### Question 19
**What's the difference between `onPause()` and `onStop()`?**

A) There's no difference  
B) `onPause()` is called when partially hidden, `onStop()` when completely hidden  
C) `onPause()` is called when completely hidden, `onStop()` when partially hidden  
D) `onPause()` is called first, `onStop()` is called last

**Answer**: B) `onPause()` is called when partially hidden, `onStop()` when completely hidden

**Explanation**: `onPause()` is called when the Activity is partially visible (e.g., dialog overlay), while `onStop()` is called when it's completely hidden.

---

#### Question 20
**Which lifecycle method is best for performing heavy operations like network requests?**

A) `onCreate()`  
B) `onResume()`  
C) `onPause()`  
D) None of the above - use background threads

**Answer**: D) None of the above - use background threads

**Explanation**: Heavy operations should be performed on background threads, not in lifecycle methods, to keep the UI responsive.
