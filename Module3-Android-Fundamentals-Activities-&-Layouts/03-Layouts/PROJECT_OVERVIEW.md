## 🎮 The Greeting App

### What It Demonstrates

The main app (`MainActivity.kt` + `activity_main.xml`) showcases:

1. **UI Components**:
   - ImageView for app logo
   - TextView for title and output
   - EditText for user input
   - Multiple buttons for different actions

2. **Layout Management**:
   - LinearLayout with vertical orientation
   - Nested LinearLayout for horizontal button arrangement
   - Proper spacing and alignment

3. **Resource Management**:
   - String resources for all text
   - Color resources for consistent theming
   - Dimension resources for spacing

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Button click listeners
   - Text change listeners
   - Input validation
   - Real-time UI updates

5. **User Experience**:
   - Input validation with error messages
   - Real-time button enabling/disabling
   - Background color changes
   - Clear functionality
