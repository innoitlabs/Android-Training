- Kotlin 1.9+ support
- Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) or physical devices

## Building the Project

### 1. Clean Build
```bash
cd ResponsiveDesign
./gradlew clean
```

### 2. Build Debug APK
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash

```

## Testing on Different Device Configurations

### Setting Up AVDs

Create the following Android Virtual Devices in Android Studio:

#### 1. Small Phone (320dp width)
- **Device**: Pixel 4a
- **API Level**: 30 or higher
- **Screen Size**: 5.8" 1080x2340
- **Density**: xhdpi

#### 2. Large Phone (480dp+ width)
- **Device**: Pixel 7 Pro
- **API Level**: 30 or higher
- **Screen Size**: 6.7" 1440x3120
- **Density**: xxxhdpi

#### 3. Tablet (600dp+ width)
- **Device**: Pixel C or Nexus 10
- **API Level**: 30 or higher
- **Screen Size**: 10.2" 2560x1600
- **Density**: xhdpi

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Phone Portrait Testing
1. Launch the app on a phone AVD
2. Verify the layout displays correctly:
   - Profile image is centered at the top
   - Text information is displayed vertically below
   - Action buttons are at the bottom
   - ScrollView works if content overflows

#### 2. Phone Landscape Testing
1. Rotate the device to landscape orientation
2. Verify the layout adapts:
   - Profile image moves to the left
   - Information is displayed horizontally
   - Bio and actions are on the right side
   - No content is cut off

#### 3. Tablet Testing
1. Launch the app on a tablet AVD
2. Verify the two-column layout:
   - Large profile image on the left
   - All information and actions on the right
   - Proper spacing and sizing
   - Text is appropriately sized for tablet

#### 4. Tablet Landscape Testing
1. Rotate the tablet to landscape
2. Verify the layout maintains the two-column design
3. Check that content is properly distributed

## Testing Checklist

### Layout Testing
- [ ] **Phone Portrait**: Vertical layout with centered content
- [ ] **Phone Landscape**: Horizontal layout with image on left
- [ ] **Tablet Portrait**: Two-column layout with large image
- [ ] **Tablet Landscape**: Maintains two-column design
- [ ] **ScrollView**: Works on small screens when needed
- [ ] **No Overflow**: Content doesn't get cut off

### Responsive Elements
- [ ] **Profile Image**: Scales appropriately for each screen size
- [ ] **Text Sizes**: Use appropriate sp values for each configuration
- [ ] **Margins/Padding**: Use appropriate dp values
- [ ] **Buttons**: Properly sized for touch interaction
- [ ] **Touch Targets**: Minimum 48dp for accessibility

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] **Edit Button**: Shows toast message when clicked
- [ ] **Follow Button**: Toggles between "Follow" and "Following"
- [ ] **Screen Rotation**: Handles configuration changes
- [ ] **Runtime Adaptation**: Detects screen size correctly

### Performance Testing
- [ ] **Layout Inflation**: Fast loading times
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks
- [ ] **Smooth Scrolling**: No lag or stuttering
- [ ] **Configuration Changes**: Smooth transitions

## Using Android Studio for Testing

### 1. Layout Inspector
1. Run the app on an AVD
2. Go to View → Tool Windows → Layout Inspector
3. Select your app process
4. Inspect the view hierarchy and properties

### 2. Layout Editor Preview
1. Open any layout file (e.g., `activity_main.xml`)
2. Use the Design view to see different configurations
3. Test different screen sizes using the device selector
4. Test different orientations

### 3. Device Manager
1. Go to Tools → AVD Manager
2. Create and manage virtual devices
3. Launch multiple devices simultaneously for comparison

## Testing with Physical Devices

If you have physical devices available:

### Android Phones
- Test on different screen sizes (4" to 7")
- Test different densities (hdpi to xxxhdpi)
- Test different Android versions

### Android Tablets
- Test on 7" to 12" tablets
- Test both portrait and landscape orientations
- Test with different aspect ratios

## Accessibility Testing

### 1. Large Text
1. Go to Settings → Accessibility → Font size
2. Increase text size to maximum
3. Verify app text scales appropriately

### 2. High Contrast
1. Go to Settings → Accessibility → High contrast text
2. Enable high contrast mode
3. Verify text is still readable

### 3. Touch Targets
- Verify all interactive elements are at least 48dp
- Test with different finger sizes
- Ensure no overlapping touch targets

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Layout Not Adapting
**Solution**: Check resource qualifiers and ensure alternative layouts exist

### Issue: Text Too Small/Large
**Solution**: Verify dimension resources are properly defined for each configuration

### Issue: Content Overflow
**Solution**: Add ScrollView or adjust layout constraints

### Issue: Build Errors
**Solution**: 
1. Clean and rebuild project
2. Check for missing resources
3. Verify ConstraintLayout dependencies

## Performance Considerations

### Layout Performance
- Use ConstraintLayout for complex layouts
- Avoid nested layouts when possible
- Keep view hierarchy flat

### Resource Management
- Use vector drawables when possible
- Optimize images for different densities
- Minimize layout complexity

### Memory Management
- Release resources in onDestroy()
- Handle configuration changes efficiently
- Use ViewBinding for view references

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, include:

1. **Device Information**:
   - Device model and screen size
   - Android version
   - Screen density

2. **Reproduction Steps**:
   - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
   - Expected vs actual behavior

3. **Screenshots/Logs**:
   - Screenshots of the issue
   - Logcat output if applicable

4. **Environment**:
   - Android Studio version
   - Build tools version
   - Gradle version

## Continuous Testing

### Automated Testing
Consider implementing automated tests for:
- Layout inflation on different screen sizes
- Configuration change handling
- Accessibility compliance

### Manual Testing
Regular manual testing on:
- New device releases
- Different Android versions
- Various screen configurations

## Conclusion

Thorough testing is essential for responsive design. Test on multiple devices, orientations, and configurations to ensure your app provides an excellent user experience across all Android devices.

Remember: **Test early, test often, test thoroughly!**
