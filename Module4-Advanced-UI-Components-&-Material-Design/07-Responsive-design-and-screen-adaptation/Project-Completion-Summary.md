- **02-Units-of-Measurement.md**: Detailed guide on Android units (dp, sp, px)
- **03-ConstraintLayout-Responsive-Design.md**: Advanced ConstraintLayout techniques
- **04-Alternative-Resources.md**: Resource qualifiers and alternative layouts
- **05-Hands-on-Lab.md**: Step-by-step lab instructions
- **06-Exercises-and-Challenges.md**: Practice exercises and advanced challenges
- **07-Summary-and-Best-Practices.md**: Best practices and summary
- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions
- **Testing-Guide.md**: Comprehensive testing instructions

### 2. Fully Functional Android Application (ResponsiveDesign/ folder)
- **Responsive Profile Screen**: Complete profile interface that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Multiple Layout Configurations**:
  - Phone portrait layout (`res/layout/activity_main.xml`)
  - Landscape layout (`res/layout-land/activity_main.xml`)
  - Tablet layout (`res/layout-sw600dp/activity_main.xml`)
- **Resource Management**:
  - Default dimensions (`res/values/dimens.xml`)
  - Tablet-specific dimensions (`res/values-sw600dp/dimens.xml`)
  - String resources (`res/values/strings.xml`)
  - Drawable resources (circle background, profile placeholder)
- **Kotlin Implementation**: Complete MainActivity with responsive logic

### 3. Key Features Implemented
- ✅ **Density Independence**: Uses dp/sp units throughout
- ✅ **Flexible Layouts**: ConstraintLayout with guidelines and constraints
- ✅ **Alternative Resources**: Different layouts for different screen sizes
- ✅ **Runtime Adaptation**: Code that detects and adapts to screen configurations
- ✅ **Interactive Elements**: Working buttons with proper touch targets
- ✅ **ScrollView Support**: Handles content overflow on small screens
- ✅ **Proper Resource Management**: Dimension resources for consistency
