# Android Accessibility Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the accessibility features implemented in the Accessibility Demo app. Follow these procedures to ensure your app is accessible to all users.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- Android device or emulator
- Android Studio
- TalkBack (built into Android)
- Accessibility Scanner (optional but recommended)

### Setup Instructions
1. **Enable Developer Options** (if not already enabled)
   - Go to Settings > About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Go back to Settings > System > Developer Options

2. **Enable USB Debugging**
   - In Developer Options, enable "USB Debugging"

## Testing with TalkBack

### Enabling TalkBack

#### Method 1: Through Settings
1. Go to Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack
2. Turn on TalkBack
3. Follow the setup wizard to learn basic gestures

#### Method 2: Through Developer Options
1. Go to Settings > System > Developer Options
2. Find "Accessibility" section
3. Enable "TalkBack" or "Accessibility Service"

### Basic TalkBack Gestures

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Swipe Right/Left | Navigate between elements |
| Double Tap | Activate selected element |
| Swipe Up/Down | Scroll |
| Two-finger Swipe | Scroll in lists |
| Two-finger Double Tap | Pause/Resume TalkBack |

### Testing Checklist

#### 1. Navigation Testing
- [ ] **App Launch**: TalkBack announces app name and main screen
- [ ] **Element Navigation**: All interactive elements are reachable
- [ ] **Focus Order**: Navigation follows logical order
- [ ] **No Focus Traps**: Can navigate away from any element

#### 2. Content Description Testing
- [ ] **App Logo**: Announces "Accessibility Demo App Logo"
- [ ] **Profile Picture**: Announces "User profile picture"
- [ ] **Buttons**: Announce their purpose (e.g., "Save profile information")
- [ ] **Decorative Elements**: Not announced (divider)

#### 3. Form Testing
- [ ] **Input Fields**: Announce their labels and hints
- [ ] **Validation**: Error messages are announced immediately
- [ ] **Focus Management**: Tab order is logical
- [ ] **Labels**: Properly associated with input fields

#### 4. Custom Views Testing
- [ ] **Progress View**: Announces progress percentage
- [ ] **Custom Button**: Announces all available actions
- [ ] **Live Regions**: Status updates are announced

#### 5. Interactive Elements Testing
- [ ] **Buttons**: Respond to double-tap
- [ ] **Long Press**: Custom actions work
- [ ] **Custom Actions**: Swipe gestures work
- [ ] **Form Submission**: Validation feedback is clear

## Step-by-Step Testing Procedure

### Phase 1: Basic Navigation

1. **Launch the App**
   ```
   Expected: "Accessibility Demo App Logo, Accessibility Demo"
   ```

   ```
   Expected sequence:
   - "Accessibility Demo App Logo"
   - "Accessibility Demo"
   - "Profile Information"
   - "User profile picture"
   - "Name, Edit text, Enter your name"
   ```

3. **Test Form Navigation**
   - Navigate through input fields
   - Verify focus order: Name → Email → Phone → Save/Cancel buttons
   ```
   Expected: Logical top-to-bottom navigation
   ```

### Phase 2: Form Validation

1. **Test Name Validation**
   - Navigate to name field
   - Enter single character
   ```
   Expected: "Name must be at least 2 characters long"
   ```

2. **Test Email Validation**
   - Navigate to email field
   - Enter invalid email
   ```
   Expected: "Please enter a valid email address"
   ```

3. **Test Phone Validation**
   - Navigate to phone field
   - Enter short number
   ```
   Expected: "Phone number must be at least 10 digits"
   ```

### Phase 3: Custom Views

1. **Test Progress View**
   - Navigate to "Start Progress" button
   - Double-tap to activate
   ```
   Expected: Progress updates announced every 500ms
   ```

2. **Test Custom Action Button**
   - Navigate to custom action button
   - Listen to announcement
   ```
   Expected: "Button, Custom Action Button. Double tap to activate, long press for options, swipe up for custom action"
   ```

3. **Test Custom Actions**
   - Double-tap: Should show "Button clicked!" toast
   - Long press: Should show "Long press detected!" toast
   - Swipe up: Should show "Custom action triggered!" toast

### Phase 4: Live Regions

1. **Test Status Updates**
   - Navigate to "Update Status" button
   - Double-tap to activate
   ```
   Expected: Random status message announced
   ```

2. **Test Error Messages**
   - Try to save with empty form
   ```
   Expected: Error message announced immediately
   ```

## Automated Testing

### Using Accessibility Scanner

1. **Install Accessibility Scanner**
   - Download from Google Play Store
   - Grant necessary permissions

2. **Scan Your App**
   - Open Accessibility Scanner
   - Navigate to your app
   - Tap "Scan" button

3. **Review Results**
   - Check for missing content descriptions
   - Verify touch target sizes
   - Review color contrast issues

### Using Android Studio Lint

1. **Run Lint Analysis**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew lint
   ```

2. **Check Accessibility Issues**
   - Look for "Accessibility" category in lint report
   - Address any warnings or errors

### Using Espresso Accessibility Testing

```kotlin
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)
class AccessibilityTest {
    
    @get:Rule
    val activityRule = ActivityScenarioRule(MainActivity::class.java)
    
    @Test
    fun testContentDescriptions() {
        onView(withId(R.id.appLogo))
            .check(matches(withContentDescription("Accessibility Demo App Logo")))
        
        onView(withId(R.id.profileImage))
            .check(matches(withContentDescription("User profile picture")))
    }
    
    @Test
    fun testFocusableElements() {
        onView(withId(R.id.saveButton))
            .check(matches(isFocusable()))
        
        onView(withId(R.id.nameInput))
            .check(matches(isFocusable()))
    }
    
    @Test
    fun testFormValidation() {
        onView(withId(R.id.nameInput))
            .perform(typeText("a"))
        
        onView(withId(R.id.errorText))
            .check(matches(withText("Name must be at least 2 characters long")))
    }
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Elements Not Announced
**Problem**: TalkBack doesn't announce certain elements
**Solution**: 
- Add `android:contentDescription` attribute
- Ensure `android:importantForAccessibility="yes"`
- Check if element is focusable

### Issue 2: Poor Focus Order
**Problem**: Navigation doesn't follow logical order
**Solution**:
- Use `android:nextFocusDown`, `android:nextFocusUp`, etc.
- Arrange elements in logical order in layout
- Test with TalkBack navigation

### Issue 3: Error Messages Not Announced
**Problem**: Validation errors not announced to screen readers
**Solution**:
- Use `announceForAccessibility()` method
- Set `android:accessibilityLiveRegion="assertive"`
- Ensure error text is visible

### Issue 4: Custom Views Not Accessible
**Problem**: Custom views don't work with TalkBack
**Solution**:
- Implement `AccessibilityDelegate`
- Override `onInitializeAccessibilityNodeInfo()`
- Add appropriate actions and descriptions

## Performance Testing

### Memory Usage
- Monitor memory usage with TalkBack enabled
- Ensure no memory leaks in accessibility implementations

### Response Time
- Test responsiveness of accessibility announcements
- Ensure custom actions respond quickly

### Battery Impact
- Monitor battery usage with accessibility features enabled
- Optimize accessibility implementations for efficiency

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG Guidelines
- **Perceivable**: Information must be perceivable to all users
- **Operable**: Interface must be operable by all users
- **Understandable**: Information must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust and compatible
