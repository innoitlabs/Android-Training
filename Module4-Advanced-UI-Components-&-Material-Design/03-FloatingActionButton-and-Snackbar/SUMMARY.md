```

### Key Features Implemented

1. **FloatingActionButton**:
   - Positioned at bottom-right corner
   - Purple background with white plus icon
   - Proper accessibility description
   - Material Design compliant styling

2. **Task Management System**:
   - Add new tasks via FAB
   - Display tasks in a scrollable list
   - Task counter for unique naming
   - Clean UI with proper spacing

3. **Snackbar Integration**:
   - Shows confirmation when task is added
   - Includes "Undo" action button
   - Proper duration and styling
   - Nested Snackbar for undo confirmation

4. **Error Handling**:
   - API compatibility fixes (removeLast → removeAt)
   - Proper null safety checks
   - Graceful handling of edge cases

## 🎯 Learning Objectives Achieved

- Learners can explain the purpose and usage of both components
- Understand Material Design principles behind these components

✅ **Add and configure FAB in XML**
- Know how to position FAB correctly
- Understand styling attributes and customization
- Can implement different FAB sizes and colors

✅ **Handle FAB click events in Kotlin**
- Implement click listeners properly
- Understand view binding and findViewById
- Can create interactive FAB functionality

✅ **Display Snackbar messages with actions**
- Know how to create and show Snackbars
- Understand different duration options
- Can implement action buttons with callbacks

✅ **Combine FAB + Snackbar for interactive flows**

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

### Build Status
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Lint checks pass
- ✅ API compatibility maintained (minSdk 24)

### Expected Runtime Behavior
1. **Initial State**: App shows "Task Manager" title and "No tasks yet" message
2. **FAB Interaction**: Purple FAB visible in bottom-right corner
3. **Add Task**: Clicking FAB adds "Task 1", "Task 2", etc.
4. **Snackbar Feedback**: Shows "Task added: Task X" with "Undo" button
5. **Undo Functionality**: Clicking "Undo" removes the last task
6. **Task Display**: Tasks shown as bulleted list with proper formatting
