# Android Animations, Motion & Gesture Handling - Complete Learning Guide

## Overview
This comprehensive learning module covers advanced Android UI animations, motion design, and gesture handling using Kotlin. The material includes both theoretical concepts and hands-on practical examples.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:
- Implement Property Animations and ObjectAnimator
- Apply View animations and transition animations
- Use MotionLayout for complex animations
- Create custom views with drawing logic
- Detect gestures and handle touch input
- Animate RecyclerView items and decorations
- Add accessibility improvements and content descriptions
- Optimize performance for animations
- Implement Material Motion & shared element transitions
- Test and debug animations effectively
